    <div id="Bio"><h2><center>Biochemistry</center></h2></div>
    <p class="col-md-6">A branch of science that focuses on the scientific study of the chemistry of living systems, their fundamental chemical substances and reactions, and their chemical pathways and information transfer systems, with particular reference to carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. During the time of achieving this major, many students are exposed to different laboratory experiences or clinical atmospheres. With a biochemisry major, people are often placed in internships with pharmacists, dentists,or other health professionals, which can offer up the chance of working within the field of medicine. This major also is useful, should an individual decide to work within the field of forensics.</p>

    <div id="CScie"><h2><center>Computer Science</center></h2></div>
    <p class="col-md-6">The science that deals with the theory and methods of processing information in digital computers, the design of computer hardware and software, and the applications of computers. Given the popular demand of this major in the job market, this is an resourceful major to have. With this major, people gain the ability to know the core foundations of different programs that are in charge of controlling a computer. Not only that, but given the technology era that we are in, many software companies are recruiting a lot more people for this field. Not only that, but there is also a great number of jobs that will be open in the following years.

    <div id="Peter"><h2><center>Petroleum Engineering</center></h2></div>
    <p class="col-md-6">Petroleum Engineering: A field of engineering concerned with the activities related to the production of hydrocarbons, which can be either crude oil or natural gas. Exploration and Production are deemed to fall within the upstream sector of the oil and gas industry. This major allows individual to apply different innovations to figure out the different methods as to how people can extract certain amounts of oil. With this field, there is a heavy presence of physics, mathematics, geology, chemistry. With a major like this,graduates are able to work in different oil reservoirs, and be able to design different schematics of surface collection and similar facilities. Different forms of technology are used during this job, which would explain why this major and computer sciene are the ones that mainly in demand.</div></p>
