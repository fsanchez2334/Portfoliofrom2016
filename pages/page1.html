        <h2><center>Chess</center></h2></div>
    <p class="col-ms-7">I am a chess fanatic, and during my free time, I typically enjoy playing chess with others or by myself.Occaisionally,I go to Washington Square Park, as well as Union Square to play the older people in a casual or timed game, commonly referred as Blitz.To better strenghten my skills, I read articles or books about chess to learn different strategies from several grandmasters.As an extracurricular activity, I volunteer at an organization that allows high school students to play chess with the elderly.One day, perhaps during my retirement years, I may seek the motivation to play competitively in FIDE competitions, and become a master.</p>

        <h2><center>Play Video Games</center></h2></div>
    <p class="col-ms-6">On some occasions, I play video games in order to relieve some stress or tension. I usually enjoy playing first-shooter games such as Call of Duty, Halo, and Destiny.Furthermore, I also spend time playing different adventure games such as the Batman Arkham Series, The Last of Us, and even Minecraft. Though I do not have a preferred platform to play on, I still enjoy the overall experience of playing with friends online or by myself. Sometimes, I play competitively or simply for the fun of it. There are often times where I can replay a game numerous times to re-experience the enjoyment of it.</p>

        <h2><center>Walking Around New York City</center></h2></div>
    <p class="col-ms-7">Often times, I feel the need to go around the city and visit different places, for it helps me to think. I usually like to visit some popular locations such as the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island Museum, Central Park, or even Chinatown.There are different times in which I am able to discover new items and culture that I did not know about. This also opens up the opportunity to meet new people, and build bonds with one another. For me, it is just a way to continue to know the city that I was born in.</p>
